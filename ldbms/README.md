# Unique features of LDBMS
- <font color="lightgreen"><strong>Managing multiple local databases</strong></font> <br>
**LDBMS** directly addresses the biggest problem with local databases which is, messy and long paths. **LDBMS** solves that by allowing the user to index , create and delete local databases from within the application and switch between them using the `use <database>` command  

- <font color="lightgreen"><strong>Compatibility with MySQL Command Line Client</strong></font> <br>
**LDBMS** borrows many commands like `create` , `show` , `use` from the **MySQL Command Line Shell** to avoid introduction of extra verbose commands and offer a relatable experience. Hence it is suitable for most curriculum which use MySQL as their Database Management System. In v0.01 , Basic MySQL Commands are supported, more will be added later.

-  <font color="lightgreen"><strong>Rich text and expressive error handling</strong></font> <br>
**LDBMS** uses the Rich framework for printing styled text on the terminal and for drawing pretty tables. It directly exposes both user and system errors with user friendly error messages and panels to isolate malformed and incorrect commands tailored towards users starting out with learning SQL.

- <font color="lightgreen"><strong>Zero Deployment & Installation headaches</strong></font> <br>
**LDBMS** is a serverless solution for practicing SQL and Database Management hence, it is essentially a single executable which you can download and run instantly. It doesn't need system applications , complicated database management applications and complicated system permissions. It manages databases , history , configuration locally using files. It does not need an internet connection or any port or socket configurations. Hence **LDBMS** is perfect for college labs and begineer users as it doesn't have users , passwords and other complications by design.

- <font color="lightgreen"><strong>Cross platform support</strong></font> <br>
Being developed with Python, LDBMS supports both Windows and Linux. It also supports Mac OS but , I will not be releasing a mac os binary as i don't have an apple computer.
